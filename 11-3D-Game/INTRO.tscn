Welcome to my 3D game!

The goal of the game is to navigate your ball down the ramp without falling off the side.

You can move your ball left and right using the 'A' and 'D' keys.

Falling off of the ramp will cause a game over!

To win the game, your ball must come in contact with the white rectangle at the end of the ramp.

To start the game press the 'Spacebar'"
